When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am collaborating with someone to work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatic push or pull might inadvertantly right over files that we are not ready to modify yet. 
To avoid this it is better to have manual push/pull cof changes to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used to copy a repository which you do not want to or have permission to change.
Clone means to copy a repository and commits can be linked to each copy of the repository.
Branch means to create a branch on master to test some new features to the code.
Use fork to copy the repository but not to make changes to that repository. Clone is done to create a copy
and have both copies linked. Branch is done to test or add new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Git can compare the status of the file with the version in state of remote to determine status of the commits.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using an online document editor like google docs or a cloud storage like dropbox. It will be difficult to track changes, also difficult to simultaneously work on a document.
 
 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 When you want to try a new feature that you are not sure will be part of the master. Doing changes in master is easier to pull/push to github. Benefit of doing changes in branch is that you do not disturb the master and the branch can be discarded if not required.
