When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am collaborating with someone to work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatic push or pull might inadvertantly right over files that we are not ready to modify yet. To avoid this it is better to have manual push/pull cof changes to the remote repository.
