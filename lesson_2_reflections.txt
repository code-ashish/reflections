What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created. You need it to track changes to the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the location where files are temporarily stored before that version of the file is saved using a commit. It allows to use commit command to save a version of multiple files at the same time.
